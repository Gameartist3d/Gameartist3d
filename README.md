- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gameartist3d
- 👀 I’m interested in video game and database design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and MySQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scripts.
- 📫 How to reach me, help with one of my scripts.

I'm obviously a newcomer. But I plan on posting project files as I implement GAS into my Unreal project and work on Databases. If you're a collaborator, feel free
to check out some of my work and add some edits. If you're an employer, have a look at some of my database work to see if we can work together on some projects.
